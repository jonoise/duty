# Duties

Once you have created a project, you can add duties to it. A <span className='text-red-500'>Duty</span> is a simple
javascript function that lives in an endpoint. It will be executed everytime you call that endpoint.

### Creating a duty

When you create a Duty you will be asked to provide a <span className='text-red-500'>name</span>, a <span className='text-red-500'>description</span> and, again, a <span className='text-red-500'>unique slug</span>. This slug will be used to identify the duty in your project.

You can test your duty by clicking on the <span className='text-red-500'>Test function</span> button. This will execute your function and show you the result on the right side of the screen.

Once you have finished testing your duty, you can save it by clicking on the <span className='text-red-500'>Save function</span> button.

### Content of a Duty

Duties <span className='text-red-500' >MUST START</span> with the statement `module.exports` and export an async function.
Otherwise the duty will fail.

### Parameters

Duties receive one parameter, which is the `Request` object. This object contains all the information about the request that was made to the endpoint.
So you can easily access the request body, headers, query parameters, etc. For a full list of the properties of the `Request` object, please refer to the [Request object documentation](/docs/request-object).

### Environment variables

You can access the environment variables of your project by using the `process.env` object. For example, if you have an environment variable called `MY_ENV_VAR`, you can access it by using `process.env.MY_ENV_VAR`.
