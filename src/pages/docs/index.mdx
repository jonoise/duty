# Introduction to Duty

Duty is the platform for minimalist developers, just write a simple Javascript function that completes a task and deploy it. And that's it, you created a duty.

We enable developers to iterate quickly and deploy pieces of code to the edge in a click of a button. Duty takes care of your infrastructure so you can focus on finding solutions and deliver fast responses to large amounts of customers.
