# Getting Started

### Sign up

If you don't have a Duty account yet, you can sign up for free [here](/signup).

### Add a project

Once you've signed up, you can create a project by clicking on the [Add project](/dashboard) button on your [dashboard](/dashboard).

You will need to provide a name for your project and select a <a className="text-red-500">unique slug</a>. You will also need to add a description.

The <span className="text-red-500">slug</span> is used to identify your project in the URL. For example, if you create a project with the slug `my-project`, the endpoints to access it will be `https://tryduty.com/api/v1/my-project/{any-duty}`.

### Add a duty

Once you've created a project, you can add a duty by clicking on the ["Add duty"](/docs/create-duty) button on your <span className="text-red-500">project details page</span>.
