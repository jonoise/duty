# API Keys

API keys are used to authenticate requests to the API. You can create API keys in the API Keys section of the dashboard of your project.

All you need to do is send the key as a header with the name `Duty-Token` in your request.

Or you can use the [Duty SDK](/docs/sdk) to interact with the API.
